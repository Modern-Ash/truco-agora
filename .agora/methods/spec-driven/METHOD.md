# Spec-Driven Development Method Pack

This pack governs delivery through an explicit specification lifecycle: draft a spec, resolve every
open question before planning, then plan, implement, and verify against it. It fits a human and an AI
agent pairing as easily as a solo actor, and needs no sprint cadence or backlog ceremony to work.

## Completion gate

- All acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- Every required artifact kind is registered.
- At least one successful evidence record exists.
- The Spec Owner has approved.
