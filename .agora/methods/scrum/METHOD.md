# Scrum Method Pack

This pack governs a small delivery swarm through an ordered, evidence-based workflow. It is not a
complete implementation of every Scrum event; project amendments may add sprint cadence and
organization-specific policies without weakening the completion gate.

## Completion gate

- All acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- Every required artifact kind is registered.
- At least one successful evidence record exists.
